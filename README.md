# course-materials

Different course materials I made during my undergraduate studies. Mainly physics and mathematics but I will also add other content.

The template of LaTeX notes is modified from the [Lecture Note Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/lecture-note-template/hvhfrrjmmyfv) by Hashem A. Damrah.

Feel free to raise any comments or suggestions in the issue part.
