Title: Lecture Notes Template

Description: A template for LaTeX-typeset lecture notes. Environments and shortcuts included. I hope that the template allows modularity -- you can recreate your notes with minimal changes.

Usage:
-   preamble.tex is where most stuff goes. Usually you wanna navigate to environment colors and change them
-   intro.tex gives an intro page
-   figures and chapters are self-explanatory
-   link the tex. files in chapters using main.tex
